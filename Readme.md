# Backend Basement

This is my personal backend development repository, ServerSmith. I'm using this space to learn, experiment, and build my skills in backend technologies. From APIs to databases, this repo will serve as my workshop as I dive into the world of server-side development.

## Why This Repo Exists
I'm starting my journey into backend development, and this repo is where I'll document my learning process. It's a place for me to try out new concepts, break things, and hopefully, build some cool projects along the way.

## What I'm Learning
Here are some of the key areas I'm focusing on:

- RESTful APIs: Understanding how to design and implement APIs.
- Databases: Learning how to connect to, query, and manage data.
- Authentication & Authorization: Implementing secure login systems.
- Server-Side Logic: Writing the code that runs on the server.
- Best Practices: Exploring design patterns and best practices for backend development.

## Technologies I'm Using
These are the tools and technologies I'm working with:

- Node.js / Express.js: For building the server.
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL: For database management.
- JWT / OAuth: For authentication.
- Docker: For containerizing the application.
- Postman: For testing APIs.
